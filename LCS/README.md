# Dynamic Programming â€” Longest Common Subsequence

**Objective:** Given two string sequences, write an algorithm to find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them.

These kind of dynamic programming questions are very famous in the interviews like Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle and many more.

**What is Longest Common Subsequence:** A longest subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous(not substring) in both the string.

#### Example:
    String A = "acbaed";
    String B = "abcadf";
